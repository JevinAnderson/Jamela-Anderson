    "summary": "I am a nurse with a bachelor degree in nursing and biology. I received my biology degree after 4 years a Mizzou. A week after graduating with that degree I entered a 15 month accelerated nursing program for a BSN.  I have been a nurse for 4 years. I have done everything from acute rehab to PCU to travel nursing. Travel nursing was one of the greatest things I did in my nursing career. It allowed me to gain years of experience in just a few months. It also greatly increased my confidence as a nurse.",
